# Problems
This is the current list of problems to tackle

## Customiation
Right now, settings are hard-coded in. Figure out how to customize and provide different configs for different input  files

## Paragraph concatenations
Merge italic and regular into a single sequence (remove the lines!)

## Identify footnote-section
remove lines, introduce new custom element (i.e change paragraph->footnote or similar)

## Pagewise Merging Of Paragraphs
Not yet activated in page.pl

## XML/EPUB Generation
The result is still prolog terms right now

### How to treat footnotes?
For now, create a Footnote-chapter last. Provide hyperlinks to footnote reference locations
